# Image_recognition-Logistic_regression_classifier
Image recognition using simple logistic regression with neural network approachf to recognize cats

## Problem set
Build a simple neural network with logistic regresssion for cat or non-cat classification.

## Dataset
Dataset in H5 file format use h5py to extract data
  - Number of training examples = 209
  - Number of testing examples = 50
  - Size of image = (64, 64, 3)

## Function description
  - Initialize parameters with zeros
  - sigmoid: calculate sigmoid function
  - propagate: forward and backward propagation 
  - optimize: Use gradient descent to optimize weights and biases
  - model: Build logistic regression model
